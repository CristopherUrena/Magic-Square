# Magic-Square
Magic Square C++ Project

This is a C++ project which illustrates different elements of C++ such as creating a structure and reading from a file. This is a coding assingment that I received in my CS2 class which required me to create multidimensional dynamic arrays, structures, and functions. I had two files given which had the magic square file where we will be reading from. My task was to write a program that can read a file of numbers arranged in rows and colums and validate if it is a magic square by checking the sum of values in the horizontal and vertical directions.
